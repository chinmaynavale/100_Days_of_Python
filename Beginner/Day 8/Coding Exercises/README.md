# Paint Area Calc

## Instructions

You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters** of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

> number of cans = (wall height ✖️ wall width) ÷ coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 ✖️ 4) ÷ 5 = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the **result should be rounded up** to **2** cans.

**Example Input**

```
test_h = 3
```

```
test_w = 9
```

**Example Output**

```
You'll need 6 cans of paint.
```

# Prime Numbers

## Instructions

> Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by itself and 1.

_You need to write a function_ that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

Here are the numbers up to 100, prime numbers are highlighted in yellow:
