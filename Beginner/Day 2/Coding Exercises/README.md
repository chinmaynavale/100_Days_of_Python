# BMI Calculator

## Instructions

_Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height._  
</br>

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**BMI = (weight / height<sup>2</sup>)**  
</br>

**Example Input**

```
Enter your weight in kg = 80
```

```
Enter your height in m = 1.75
```

**Example Output**

80 รท 1.75 x 1.75 = 26.122448979591837

```
Your BMI is: 26
```
