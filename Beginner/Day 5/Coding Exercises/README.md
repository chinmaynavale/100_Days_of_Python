# Average Height

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. `student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]`

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = **1146**

There are a total of **7** heights in `student_heights`

1146 รท 7 = **163.71428571428572**

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = **164**

**Important** You should not use the `sum()` function in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using for loops.  
</br>

**Example Input**

```
156 178 165 171 187
```

In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

**Example Output**

```
171
```

# High Score

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. `student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

**Important** you are not allowed to use the max or min functions.

**Example Input**

```
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
```

In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: `[78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

**Example Output**

```
The highest score in the class is: 91
```

# Adding Evens

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100, including 2 and 100.

e.g. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

```
sum of even numbers: 2550
```

# The FizzBuzz

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

</br >

`Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.`

`When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".`

`When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

`And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`

e.g. it might start off like this:

```
`1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz`
```

`.... etc.`
